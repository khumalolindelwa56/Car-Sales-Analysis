# Car-Sales-Analysis
A data analysis project exploring car sales performance, pricing trends, and customer preferences using SQL, Excel, and Python (Pandas). Includes data cleaning, visualization, and key performance metrics to uncover insights that drive smarter business decisions.

# Problem Statement
Car dealerships often struggle to understand which car types, brands, and models drive the most sales or generate the highest revenue. Without a clear view of sales performance and customer preferences, decision-making becomes reactive rather than strategic.
This project seeks to address that gap by performing a detailed analysis of car sales data to identify key factors influencing sales trends.

# Aim
To analyze car sales data, clean and visualize it, and provide actionable insights into factors affecting sales performance and revenue growth.

# Objectives
Clean and prepare the dataset by removing duplicates and missing values.
Identify the most popular car brands, models, and types based on sales volume.
Analyze pricing trends across regions and time periods.
Measure total revenue and average sales per car model.
Build visual dashboards to summarize key metrics and trends.
Provide recommendations to improve future sales performance.
